# Skin-Disease-Classification-Model
This project uses EfficientNet0 and the Diverse Dermatology Images dataset to create a reliable, fairness-aware model for classifying skin conditions into benign or malignant across varied skin tones. The aim is to turn images into actionable, responsible support for clinicians, researchers, and health programs. It does not replace expert judgement, but extends reach, speeds up triage, and surface patterns that can help improve care.

Broader outcomes

Improve access: enable fast, scalable screening especially in malignant cases in low-resource or remote settings where dermatology specialists are scarce.

Support clinical workflow: provide a second opinion or triage cue that helps clinicians prioritize cases.

Reduce bias: evaluate and mitigate differences in model behavior across skin tones to make tools safer and more equitable.

Research & benchmarking: serve as a reproducible baseline for experimentation with architectures, augmentation, and fairness techniques.

Public health & operations: aggregate anonymized predictions to monitor trends, outbreaks, or service demand.

This model can be applied as a

Triage assistant: flags likely urgent conditions by recognising malignant cases for faster clinician review.

Screening tool: run routine scans to detect common conditions and recommend follow-up.

Decision support: supply model probabilities alongside explanations to help clinicians interpret edge cases.

Dataset analysis: compare class distributions and model gaps to guide data collection efforts that improve equity.
